README for @, also known as monkey-tail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What?
-----

@ is a swiss army knife for the *Nix user, and is self-contained and portable.


Why?
----

Well, I feel that it's nice to have a collection of simple commands in a
separate utility, rather than "polluting" the shell namespace.

You can hang @ on your belt, along with your shell, editor and your C compiler.


How?
----

Copy @ into your usual directory for scripts, etc

Then, simply run:

	@ list-commands

For example, to show disk usage of the current directory:

 	@ disk-usage

Or, find the disk hogs in your downloads directory:

	@ disk-hogs ~/Downloads


Modify?
-------

Of course! @ is licenced under the GPLv2, meaning you can customise it for your
own needs.

Each command in @ is a bash function, prefixed with _ (underscore). For example:

	_my-command () {
	 echo "Hello there!"
	}

Can be accessed by:

	@ my-command

@ provides a few built in functions, and eventually there will be more.


By Who?
